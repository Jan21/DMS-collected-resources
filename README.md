## [AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim)

AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on Unreal Engine.

* Realisim is quite good, can simulate weather conditions, it's a plugin for UE4

## [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) 

CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.

* Not very realistic output, UE4, weather conditions

## [UnrealCV](https://github.com/unrealcv/unrealcv)

* Plugin to UE4, has a python client

## [Sim4CV](https://sim4cv.org/#services)

* UE4

## [Driving In The Matrix](https://fcav.engin.umich.edu/sim-dataset/)

* Only images with labels, non-commertial purposes

## [Synthia](http://synthia-dataset.net/)

* Images with labels

## [Playing for Benchmarks](https://playing-for-benchmarks.org/overview/)

* GTA, non-commertial purposes
